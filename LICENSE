ATTRIBUTION NOTICE:

This software is built upon the Secret Sauce project. The training data,
synthesizer configurations, and core methodologies are derived from the
groundbreaking Secret Sauce machine learning system for automatic sound
reverse engineering.

Special thanks to the Secret Sauce creator for providing the foundational
research, training data, and synthesizer parameter mappings that make
SynthWhisperer possible.

The Secret Sauce project pioneered the field of automatic studio sound
reverse engineering and established the techniques that SynthWhisperer
extends for natural language interaction.
